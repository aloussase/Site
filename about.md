## I am a software consultant @ Thoughtworks

I love building personal projects to challenge myself and keep learning new
stuff. My specific interests include distributed systems and compilers.
I also have a liking for infra and run a home lab where this site is deployed :).

Professionally, I have the most experience with Java. Personally, however,
my favourite language is Haskell. I have keen interest in functional programming
and believe everyone should at least dabble with it at least once.

## Journey at Thoughtworks

I just started in January 2025. Not much to say yet! Other than that the 
company fosters a real inclusive and respectful culture and puts much emphasis
in continuous learning, which I love!

## Journey before that

I got my first job at the start of 2024. It was for an intern position at a 
shrimp company in Ecuador. It was a mess. I just did web forms with Vue.js and
Laravel. But development was chaotic. No code reviews. No tests. No CI pipeline.
No collaboration of any sort. The code itself was also a nightmare. There were
things that I could not even imagine of writing if I was in a contest for the
most convoluted and obfuscated code.

Later that year, I got a better job at a retail company, also as an intern. People were
great, but then again, there really wasn't a quality culture. And by this time
I think that that is a common theme for local businesses in Ecuador. I got
offered a fulltime position 3 months into my internship, and accepted it. One
month after this, I got into Thoughtworks and left the company. I used mostly
Java and SpringBoot here.

In parallel with this last job, I also had a contract for building an
application for my school. It was good because I had full control of the
tech stack (turns out I didn't, but I thought so hehehe), and was in charge
of the dev team. I only wish they had given us a server for CI/CD, since I 
crashed the dev server many times during pipelines. We used SvelteKit, 
.NET (C# & F#) and Flutter.

## Education

### 2019 - 2025

I studied Computer Engineering at Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral.
I actually was majoring in Biology at first, but then switched. Probably the
best decision I've ever made.

I have mixed feelings about my education. I don't think I got anything of 
value there other than the people I met. And this is a **lot** of value.
I met many people I deeply admire and who I look up to in my day to day.
Also, my whole education was free, so I can't complain.

I have very strong opinions about CS education in my country, and I have
plans to make help make it better. Because I've met a lot of smart people and
I know Ecuador has the potential to produce high quality software and make
important contributions to the world. I just think we worry about the wrong 
things.
